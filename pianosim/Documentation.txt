My project is a simulation of a piano. 

It can be played by either clicking and holding the piano keys, or by using your computer keyboard. 

Key bindings can be found by clicking the controls button on the top bar. 

What you play can also be recorded using the record and load buttons on the bottom.

For information on how to use these, click the help button on the top bar.

All code is contained within the files:
PianoSim.java            : The main program which is to be run.
Key.java                 : Contains methods for generating the piano layout.
MyClip.java              : A rewrite of BasicGrapics audio which allows for the playing of multiple audio files.
RecordedClip.java        : Allows for recording of MyClips, including start time and duration of play
RecordedTrack.java       : Maintains an array of all RecordedClips and methods for playing them.


The Piano can also be resized using the scale final field in PianoSim. It needs to be an integerr divisible by 3.
The number of octaves the piano has can also be changed by the final field in PianoSim. However, only the first 2 octaves have audio.
